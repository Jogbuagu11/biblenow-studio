# Jitsi Meet JWT Authentication - Room Mismatch Fix

## Problem Description

Users were experiencing "Room and token mismatched" errors when trying to join Jitsi Meet livestreams. The error message was:
```
CONFERENCE FAILED: conference.connectionError.notAllowed general Room and token mismatched
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the **room path construction** in the `LiveStream.tsx` component. Here's what was happening:

### Before the Fix:
1. **JWT Token contained**: `room: "unto-us-a-son-is-given"`
2. **Frontend constructed**: `iframeRoomPath = "stream.biblenow.io/unto-us-a-son-is-given"`
3. **Jitsi server expected**: Room name in JWT to match URL room name exactly

The frontend was incorrectly prepending the sub domain (`stream.biblenow.io`) to the room name, creating a mismatch between:
- JWT room claim: `"unto-us-a-son-is-given"`
- URL room name: `"stream.biblenow.io/unto-us-a-son-is-given"`

### The Problem Code:
```typescript
// WRONG: This was causing the mismatch
if (jwtPayload.sub) {
  iframeRoomPath = `${jwtPayload.sub}/${roomName}`;
  console.log('JWT has sub claim, iframe room path:', iframeRoomPath);
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### Fixed Code:
```typescript
// CORRECT: Room names now match exactly
if (payload.room && payload.room !== roomName) {
  console.warn('Room name mismatch - JWT room:', payload.room, 'URL room:', roomName);
  // Use the room name from JWT to ensure consistency
  iframeRoomPath = payload.room;
} else {
  console.log('Room names match - JWT room:', payload.room, 'URL room:', roomName);
  iframeRoomPath = roomName;
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Removed sub domain prepending**: No longer adding `stream.biblenow.io/` to room names
2. **Added room name verification**: Checks if JWT room matches URL room
3. **Consistent room naming**: Uses the same room name format throughout
4. **Better error handling**: Logs mismatches for debugging

## JWT Token Structure

The JWT token now has the correct structure:
```json
{
  "aud": "biblenow",
  "iss": "biblenow",
  "sub": "stream.biblenow.io",
  "room": "unto-us-a-son-is-given",
  "exp": 1234567890,
  "iat": 1234567890,
  "nbf": 1234567890,
  "context": {
    "user": {
      "id": "user@email.com",
      "name": "Display Name",
      "moderator": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Results

Comprehensive testing shows the fix works correctly:

### ✅ Room Name Consistency:
- JWT room: `"unto-us-a-son-is-given"`
- URL room: `"unto-us-a-son-is-given"`
- **Result**: Perfect match

### ✅ Special Character Handling:
- Input: `"Room-With-Capitals"`
- JWT room: `"room-with-capitals"`
- **Result**: Consistent processing

### ✅ Iframe Room Path:
- Final path: `"unto-us-a-son-is-given"`
- JWT room: `"unto-us-a-son-is-given"`
- **Result**: Exact match

## Environment Configuration

Ensure your `server/.env` file has the correct JWT configuration:

```bash
# Jitsi JWT Configuration (REQUIRED for authentication)
JITSI_JWT_APP_ID=biblenow
JITSI_JWT_SECRET=your_actual_secret_key_here
JITSI_SUBJECT=stream.biblenow.io
JITSI_DOMAIN=stream.biblenow.io
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Test JWT Token Generation**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-room-mismatch-fix.js
   ```

2. **Check Room Name Consistency**:
   - Verify JWT room matches URL room exactly
   - No sub domain prepending in room names

3. **Test Livestream Joining**:
   - Try joining a livestream with authentication
   - Should no longer see "Room and token mismatched" error

4. **Monitor Console Logs**:
   - Look for "Room names match" messages
   - No more "Room name mismatch" warnings

## Files Modified

- `src/components/LiveStream.tsx`: Fixed room path construction logic
- `scripts/test-room-mismatch-fix.js`: Added comprehensive test script

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Successful Authentication**: Users can join livestreams without room mismatch errors
2. **Consistent Room Names**: JWT room claim matches URL room name exactly
3. **Proper Error Handling**: Clear logging for debugging room name issues
4. **Special Character Support**: Room names with spaces, capitals, and special chars work correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience issues:

1. **Check JWT Token**: Decode at jwt.io to verify room claim
2. **Verify Environment**: Ensure JWT secret is properly set in server/.env
3. **Check Server Logs**: Look for JWT generation errors
4. **Test Token Generation**: Run the test script to verify token structure

## Conclusion

The "Room and token mismatched" error has been resolved by ensuring that:
- Room names in JWT tokens match URL room names exactly
- No sub domain is prepended to room names
- Consistent room name processing throughout the application
- Proper error handling and logging for debugging

This fix ensures reliable Jitsi Meet authentication for all users joining livestreams.
