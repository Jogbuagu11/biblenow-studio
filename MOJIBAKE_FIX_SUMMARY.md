# Mojibake Fix Summary

## Problem Solved
The `/live` routes were displaying binary/gzipped content rendered as text (mojibake) in the DOM. This was causing users to see gibberish characters instead of the proper live stream page.

## Root Cause
1. The React app was trying to handle `/live` routes through client-side routing
2. Binary content from the upstream server was being treated as text
3. Gzip compression was causing the response to be unreadable when rendered as text

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Server-Side Proxy Routes
Added proxy routes in `server/index.js` that:
- **Disable gzip compression** by setting `Accept-Encoding: ""` header
- **Properly forward content-type headers** to ensure correct rendering
- **Stream responses** to prevent memory issues
- **Add comprehensive logging** for debugging

### 2. Routes Added
```javascript
// Proxy /live/:room routes
app.get('/live/:room', async (req, res) => {
  // Proxies to https://studio.biblenow.io/live?room={room}
  // with gzip disabled
});

// Handle bare /live route
app.get('/live', async (req, res) => {
  // Proxies to https://studio.biblenow.io/live
  // with gzip disabled
});
```

### 3. Dependencies Added
- `node-fetch@2` for making HTTP requests in the server

### 4. Test Script Created
- `scripts/test-live-proxy.js` to verify the fix works correctly

## Test Results
✅ **No mojibake detected** - Response is proper text  
✅ **Content-Encoding: null** - Gzip compression disabled  
✅ **Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8** - Proper content type  
✅ **Response status: 200** - Successful response  

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Server Changes
```bash
# The server changes are already in place
# Make sure to deploy the updated server/index.js file
```

### 2. Verify the Fix
```bash
# Test locally
node scripts/test-live-proxy.js

# Or test manually by visiting:
# https://your-domain.com/live/test-room
```

### 3. Monitor Logs
The proxy includes comprehensive logging:
- Request URLs being proxied
- Response status codes
- Content-type headers
- Any errors during proxying

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
- `/live/room-name` showed gibberish characters
- Response headers included `Content-Encoding: gzip`
- Binary content rendered as text in DOM

### After Fix
- `/live/room-name` renders the proper live stream page
- Response headers do NOT include `Content-Encoding: gzip`
- Content is properly decoded and rendered

## Files Modified
1. `server/index.js` - Added proxy routes
2. `server/package.json` - Added node-fetch dependency
3. `scripts/test-live-proxy.js` - Created test script
4. `LIVE_PROXY_FIX.md` - Created deployment guide

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the server changes to production
2. Test the `/live` routes in production
3. Monitor server logs for any proxy issues
4. Remove the test script once confirmed working

The fix is now ready for deployment and should resolve the mojibake issue completely.
