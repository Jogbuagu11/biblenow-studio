## **Email Notification Thresholds**

The independent email system will send notifications at:
- **75% usage warning**: When users reach 75% of their plan's streaming limit
- **100% limit reached**: When users reach or exceed their plan's streaming limit

### **75% Warning Thresholds:**
- Olive: 135 minutes (2.25 hours)
- Branch: 270 minutes (4.5 hours)
- Vine: 540 minutes (9 hours)
- Cedar: 1080 minutes (18 hours)

### **100% Limit Thresholds:**
- Olive: 180 minutes (3 hours)
- Branch: 360 minutes (6 hours)
- Vine: 720 minutes (12 hours)
- Cedar: 1440 minutes (24 hours)

The independent email system queries the database directly for these limits, so it will automatically use the correct values when calculating usage percentages.
