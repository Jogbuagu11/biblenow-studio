# Jitsi Authentication Required - No Anonymous Users

## Problem
The Jitsi integration was allowing anonymous users to join livestreams without authentication, which is not allowed in this application.

## Solution
Updated the Jitsi configuration to require authentication for all users and disable anonymous access.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated LiveStream Component (`src/components/LiveStream.tsx`)

**Authentication Requirements:**
- Set `authenticationRequired: true` to require authentication for all users
- Removed `anonymousUserRole: 'guest'` to disable anonymous users
- Added authentication checks that redirect unauthenticated users to login
- Made JWT token generation mandatory for all users

**JWT Token Generation:**
- JWT tokens are now required for all users (not optional)
- If JWT token generation fails, users are redirected to login
- If user verification fails, users are redirected to login
- If no user is authenticated, users are redirected to login

**Interface Configuration:**
- Enabled `SHOW_PREJOIN_PAGE: true` to show authentication page
- Disabled `SHOW_WELCOME_PAGE: false` to skip welcome page
- Maintained chat functionality and custom branding

### 2. Authentication Flow

**Before Joining a Livestream:**
1. User must be authenticated through the app's login system
2. User's profile is verified against the `verified_profiles` table
3. JWT token is generated for the user with appropriate permissions
4. If any step fails, user is redirected to login page

**Jitsi Connection:**
1. Jitsi receives the JWT token for authentication
2. User joins with authenticated credentials
3. No anonymous or guest access is allowed

### 3. Error Handling

**Authentication Failures:**
- JWT token generation failure → Redirect to login
- User verification failure → Redirect to login  
- No authenticated user → Redirect to login
- Server errors → Redirect to login

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Jitsi JWT Configuration
REACT_APP_JITSI_DOMAIN=your-jitsi-domain.com
REACT_APP_JITSI_APP_ID=your-app-id
REACT_APP_JITSI_JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret

# Server Configuration
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api

# Server Environment Variables
JITSI_JWT_APP_ID=biblenow
JITSI_JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
JITSI_SUBJECT=stream.biblenow.io
```

## Security Features

- **No Anonymous Access**: All users must be authenticated
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **User Verification**: Users must be in verified_profiles table
- **Automatic Redirects**: Failed authentication redirects to login
- **Token Expiration**: JWT tokens expire after 1 hour

## Testing

To verify the changes are working:

1. **Unauthenticated Access**: Try to access a livestream without logging in → Should redirect to login
2. **Invalid User**: Try to access with invalid credentials → Should redirect to login
3. **Valid User**: Login with valid credentials → Should be able to join livestream
4. **JWT Token**: Check browser console for JWT token generation logs

## Troubleshooting

If users are still able to access livestreams anonymously:

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure all JWT-related variables are set
2. **Verify Server Configuration**: Check that JWT secret is properly configured
3. **Check Browser Console**: Look for authentication-related errors
4. **Verify User Authentication**: Ensure users are properly logged in before accessing livestreams

## Code Changes Summary

### LiveStream.tsx Changes:
```typescript
// Authentication is now required
authenticationRequired: true,
passwordRequired: false,

// JWT token is mandatory
jwt: jwtToken, // JWT token is required for all users

// Authentication checks with redirects
if (!user) {
  window.location.href = '/login';
  return;
}

// Error handling with redirects
if (jwtTokenGenerationFails) {
  window.location.href = '/login';
  return;
}
```

This ensures that only authenticated users can access Jitsi livestreams, maintaining the security requirements of the application.
